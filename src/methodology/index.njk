<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
  Cheffist uses a conservative approach to storage guidance. Ranges are intended to reduce risk,
  not to promise that food is always safe for a specific number of days.
</p>
<p>
  Shelf-life ranges are expressed as minimum and maximum day windows for pantry, fridge, and
  freezer storage. These values assume normal household handling and steady temperatures.
</p>
<p>Assumptions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Food is stored promptly and in clean containers.</li>
  <li>Cold foods stay refrigerated near 40F or below.</li>
  <li>Frozen foods remain continuously frozen.</li>
  <li>Visible spoilage, odor changes, or texture changes override any date estimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Calculator logic is not implemented yet. Current pages provide educational ranges and safety
  reminders only.
