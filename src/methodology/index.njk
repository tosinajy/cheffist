  <div class="mt-6 space-y-5 text-slate-700">
    <p>Cheffist uses a conservative methodology designed to reduce risk in home food handling.</p>
    <p>Each food entry includes pantry, fridge, and freezer ranges with cautious minimum and maximum day windows. We prioritize safer defaults over optimistic timelines.</p>
    <p>Assumptions include proper refrigeration, consistent temperatures, clean storage containers, and normal household handling. Real-world conditions may shorten safe windows.</p>
    <p>Calculator logic is not published in this phase. This page documents baseline assumptions and data framing only.</p>
    <p>When uncertainty exists, we recommend disposal over consumption.</p>
